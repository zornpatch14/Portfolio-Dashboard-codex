Riskfolio,Mean-Risk Settings,Description,Objective,"Objective controls what the optimiser is trying to maximise or minimise. 'Max Risk-Adjusted Return' (Sharpe) maximises (return - risk-free) per unit of risk, 'Min Risk' minimises portfolio risk, 'Max Return' maximises return, and 'Utility' minimises risk minus λ times expected return.",Description of objective options
Riskfolio,Mean-Risk Settings,Description,Return Model,Return Model defines how returns are calculated. 'Arithmetic' computes returns as P_t / P_{t-1} - 1; 'Approximate log' uses ln(P_t) - ln(P_{t-1}); 'Exact log' uses exp(ln(P_t / P_{t-1})) - 1. The difference between approximate and exact log returns is very small for daily data but may accumulate over long horizons or large price changes.,Description of return models
Riskfolio,Mean-Risk Settings,Description,Risk Measure,Risk Measure determines how portfolio risk is computed. 'Variance' uses the covariance of returns. 'Semi-Variance' uses only returns below the mean. 'CVaR' (Conditional Value at Risk) estimates expected losses beyond a value-at-risk threshold. 'CDaR' (Conditional Drawdown at Risk) measures average drawdown beyond the VaR. 'EVaR' (Expected Value at Risk) is a more conservative tail measure.,Description of risk measures
Riskfolio,Mean-Risk Settings,Description,Risk-Free Rate (annual %),Risk-Free Rate (annual %) sets the risk-free rate used for risk-adjusted objectives such as Sharpe. Typical values range from 0% to 5%. The optimiser converts this annual percentage to a daily decimal.,Description of risk-free rate input
Riskfolio,Mean-Risk Settings,Description,Risk Aversion (λ),Risk Aversion λ is used when the Utility objective is selected. A lower λ emphasises return while a higher λ emphasises risk. Recommended values are between 1 and 5.,Description of risk aversion parameter
Riskfolio,Mean-Risk Settings,Description,Confidence Level α,"Confidence Level α specifies the percentile used for tail-based risk measures (CVaR, CDaR, EVaR). Typical values are 5% to 10%. A smaller α focuses on more extreme tail events.",Description of confidence level
Riskfolio,Mean-Risk Settings,Description,Covariance Method,Covariance Method controls how the covariance matrix is estimated. 'Sample' uses sample covariance; 'EWMA' uses an exponentially weighted moving average; 'Ledoit-Wolf' shrinks the sample covariance towards the identity matrix to reduce estimation error.,Description of covariance estimation methods
Riskfolio,Mean-Risk Settings,Description,Weight Bounds,Weight Bounds specify the minimum and maximum allocation per asset. Use 0 to 1 for a long-only portfolio. Allowing a negative minimum permits short positions. Setting a maximum less than 1 encourages diversification.,Description of per-asset weight bounds
Riskfolio,Mean-Risk Settings,Description,Budget,Budget represents the sum of portfolio weights. A budget of 1 means the portfolio is fully invested. Values greater than 1 imply leverage; values less than 1 leave some capital uninvested.,Description of budget parameter
Riskfolio,Mean-Risk Settings,Description,Group Caps,"Group Caps let you set an upper limit on the combined weight of specific symbols. Use the format 'AAPL,MSFT=0.5' to restrict the total weight of AAPL and MSFT to 50%. Separate multiple group caps with commas.",Description of group caps input
Riskfolio,Mean-Risk Settings,Description,Strategy Caps,"Strategy Caps let you limit the total allocation to a trading strategy. Enter values as 'trend=0.6, mean_reversion=0.4' to cap each strategy.",Description of strategy caps input
Riskfolio,Mean-Risk Settings,Description,Turnover Cap,Turnover Cap sets an upper limit on portfolio turnover. This feature is reserved for future use and the input is disabled.,Description of turnover cap input
